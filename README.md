<strong><a href="https://www.php.net/">PHP</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://getcomposer.org/">Composer</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a></strong>, and <strong><a href="https://nodejs.org/">Node</a></strong>.<br>
In addition, it is good to have an editor to work with the code like <strong><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VSCode</a></strong> or <strong><a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/">PHP Storm</a></strong>.

This app uses <strong><a href="https://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a></strong>. To use something different, open up <code>config/Database.php</code> and change the default driver.<br>
